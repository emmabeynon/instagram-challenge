This is my submission for the Makers Academy Week 7 Weekend Challenge: https://github.com/makersacademy/instagram-challenge


Overview
---------

This week we have been tasked with building an Instagram clone.  I created the following user stories based on the brief:

```
As a user
So that I can use Instagram
I would like to post pictures on it

As a user
So that I can post pictures on Instagram
I would like to create my own account

As a user
So that I can show that I posted a picture
I would like my username to be displayed with a picture I posted

As a user
So that I can share my thoughts on a picture
I would like to write a comment on a picture

As a user
So that I can show my appreciation for a picture
I would like to 'like' a picture
```

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!
